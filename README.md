# Hangman--BobRein
This hangman program takes in the length of you word and then guesses letters until it guesses correct. Open HangManClient.java for the code that I wrote. The read from langList.txt to get all English words. Right now it simply implemented with an array. I plan to improve efficiency with a TRIE.
